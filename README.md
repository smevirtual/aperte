## Aperte

**Aperte** is a lightweight data platform for membership-based communities.
It is slightly opinionated for volunteer-powered [SME](http://www.sme.org/)
chapters and communities, but it is customizable and can be adapted to various
other use cases.

### Motivation

Feedback and openness are essential ingredients for successful and engaging chapters.
Without these traits, members feel disconnected from the chapter leadership and
might resist participation in a chapter where they feel they have no voice
or clarity - understandably so.

The Internet is a powerful platform for collaboration and openness. Aperte is
an effort to provide a relatively convenient method for SME chapters to deploy an
open data platform for the benefit of membership and leaders alike.
